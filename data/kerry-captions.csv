3,4,-1,"Bob, and"
4,6,-1,
6,7,-1,I think if you
7,8,-1,were to talk
8,9,-1,to
9,10,-1,Dick Cheney's
10,11,0,"daughter,"
11,12,-1,
12,14,-1,"who is a lesbian, she"
14,15,-1,would tell you
15,16,-1,", that she's being"
16,17,5,who she was.
17,20,5,She's being who she was born as.
20,21,-1,
21,22,-1,I think if you talk to
22,23,-1,"anybody,"
23,24,-1,
24,26,5,it's not choice.
26,28,-1,I've met people who've
28,30,0,"struggled with this for years,"
30,31,-1,people who were in a
31,32,-1,marriage
32,33,-1,because they were
33,35,5,"living a sort of convention,"
35,36,-1,and they
36,37,0,struggled with it.
37,38,-1,And I've met

42,44,-1,when they finally sort of
44,45,-1,broke out
45,46,-1,and
46,48,5,allowed themselves to live who they were
48,50,2,who they felt God had made them.
50,51,-1,I think we have to
51,52,3,respect that.
52,54,-1,The President and I share the
54,55,-1,belief
55,56,-1,that marriage
56,57,-1,is between a man and a
57,59,-1,woman. I believe that.
59,61,-1,I believe marriage is between a man and a woman.
61,62,-1,
62,63,-1,But I also believe that because
63,65,2,"we are the United States of America,"
65,69,-1,"we're a county with a great, unbelievable Constitution, with"
69,71,1,"rights that we afford people, that"
71,72,1,you can't discriminate
72,73,-1,in the workplace.
73,74,1,You can't discriminate in the rights
74,75,-1,that you afford people.
75,80,1,You can't disallow someone the right to visit their parner in a hospital.
80,81,-1,You have to
81,82,1,allow people to transfer
82,83,-1,"property, which is why"
83,85,1,I'm for partnership rights and so forth.
