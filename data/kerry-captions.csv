3,4,0,"Bob, and"
4,6,0,
6,7,0,I think if you
7,8,0,were to talk
8,9,0,to
9,10,0,Dick Cheney's
10,11,0,"daughter,"
11,12,0,
12,14,0,"who is a lesbian, she"
14,15,0,would tell you
15,16,0,", that she's being"
16,17,1,who she was.
17,20,1,She's being who she was born as.
20,21,0,
21,22,0,I think if you talk to
22,23,0,"anybody,"
23,24,0,
24,26,1,it's not choice.
26,28,0,I've met people who've
28,30,1,"struggled with this for years,"
30,31,0,people who were in a
31,32,0,marriage
32,33,0,because they were
33,35,1,"living a sort of convention,"
35,36,0,and they
36,37,1,struggled with it.
37,38,0,And I've met
38,42,1,"wives who are supportive of their husbands, or vice versa,"
42,44,0,when they finally sort of
44,45,1,broke out
45,46,0,and
46,48,1,allowed themselves to live who they were
48,50,1,who they felt God had made them.
50,51,0,I think we have to
51,52,1,respect that.
52,54,0,The President and I share the
54,55,0,belief
55,56,0,that marriage
56,57,0,is between a man and a
57,59,0,woman. I believe that.
59,61,0,I believe marriage is between a man and a woman.
61,62,0,
62,63,0,But I also believe that because
63,65,1,"we are the United States of America,"
65,69,0,"we're a county with a great, unbelievable Constitution, with"
69,71,1,"rights that we afford people, that"
71,72,1,you can't discriminate
72,73,0,in the workplace.
73,74,1,You can't discriminate in the rights
74,75,0,that you afford people.
75,80,1,You can't disallow someone the right to visit their parner in a hospital.
80,81,0,You have to
81,82,1,allow people to transfer
82,85,0,"property, which is why I'm for partnership rights and so forth."
