0,1,1,"You know, Bob, I don't know."
1,3,0,
3,4,1,I just don't know.
4,5,1,I do know that
5,7,1,"we have a choice to make in America,"
7,8,1,and that is to
8,11,1,treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity.
11,13,0,It's important that we do that.
13,16,0,"I also know, in a free society, people, "
16,18,1,"consenting adults, can live the way they want to live."
18,20,0,And that's to be honored.
20,22,1,But as we respect someone's rights
22,23,0,
23,24,0,and as we
24,26,1,"profess tolerance,"
26,28,1,we shouldn't changeâ€”or have to change our
28,29,0,basic views on the
29,31,1,sanctity of marriage.
31,33,1,I believe in the sanctity of marriage.
33,34,0,
34,35,0,I think it's very important that we
35,37,1,protect marriage as an institution
37,39,0,between a man and a woman.
39,42,1,I proposed a constitutional amendment.
42,45,0,The reason I did so was because I was worred that activist
45,49,1,judges are actually defining the definition of marriage.
49,50,0,And the surest way to
50,51,1,protect marriage
51,54,0,between a man and woman is to amend the Constitution.
54,57,0,It has also the benefit of allowing citizens
57,58,1,to participate in the process.
58,59,0,"After all, when you"
59,60,0,amend the Constitution
60,62,1,State legislatures must participate
62,64,0,in the ratification of the Constitution.
64,66,0,I'm deeply concerned that
66,68,0,judges are making those decisions
68,71,1,and not the citizenry of the United States.
