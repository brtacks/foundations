0,1,-1,"You know, Bob, I don't know."
1,3,-1,
3,4,2,I just don't know.
4,5,-1,I do know that
5,7,2,"we have a choice to make in America,"
7,8,-1,and that is to
8,11,1,treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity.
11,13,-1,It's important that we do that.
13,16,-1,"I also know, in a free society, people, "
16,18,5,"consenting adults, can live the way they want to live."
18,20,-1,And that's to be honored.
20,22,1,But as we respect someone's rights
22,23,-1,
23,24,-1,and as we
24,26,1,"profess tolerance,"
26,28,5,we shouldn't change&mdash;or have to change our
28,29,-1,basic views on the
29,31,4,sanctity of marriage.
31,33,4,I believe in the sanctity of marriage.
33,34,-1,
34,35,-1,I think it's very important that we
35,37,3,protect marriage as an institution
37,39,-1,between a man and a woman.
39,42,3,I proposed a constitutional amendment.
42,45,-1,The reason I did so was because I was worred that activist
45,49,5,judges are actually defining the definition of marriage.
49,50,-1,And the surest way to
50,51,3,protect marriage
51,54,-1,between a man and woman is to amend the Constitution.
54,57,-1,It has also the benefit of allowing citizens
57,58,2,to participate in the process.
58,59,-1,"After all, when you"
59,60,-1,amend the Constitution
60,62,5,State legislatures must participate
62,64,-1,in the ratification of the Constitution.
64,66,-1,I'm deeply concerned that
66,68,-1,judges are making those decisions
68,71,5,and not the citizenry of the United States.
