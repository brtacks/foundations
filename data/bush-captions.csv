0,0,4,1,"You know, Bob, I don't know. I just don't know."
1,4,7,1,"I do know that we have a choice to make in America,"
2,7,11,1,and that is to treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity.
3,11,13,0,It's important that we do that.
4,13,18,1,"I also know, in a free society, people, consenting adults, can live the way they want to live."
5,18,20,0,And that's to be honored. 
6,20,22,1,But as we respect someone's rights
7,22,23,0,
8,23,24,0,and as we
9,24,26,1,"profess tolerance,"
10,26,28,1,we shouldn't changeâ€”or have to change our
11,28,29,0,basic views on the
12,29,31,1,sanctity of marriage.
13,31,33,1,I believe in the sanctity of marriage
14,33,34,0,
15,34,35,0,I think it's very important that we
16,35,37,1,protect marriage as an institution
17,37,39,0,between a mman and a woman.
18,39,42,1,I proposed a constitutional amendment.
19,42,45,0,The reason I did so was because I was worred that activist
20,45,49,1,judges are actually defining the definition of marriage.
21,49,51,1,And the surest way to protect marriage
22,51,54,0,between a man and woman is to amend the Constitution.
23,54,57,0,It has also the beneit of allowing citizens
24,57,59,1,"to participate in the process. After all, when you"
25,59,60,0,amend the Constitution
26,60,62,1,State legislatures must participate
27,62,64,0,in the ratification of the Constitution.
28,64,66,0,I'm deeply concerned that
29,66,68,0,judges are making those decisions
30,68,71,1,and not the citizenry of the United States.
