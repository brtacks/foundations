# Summary

Morality binds; morality blinds.

According to Jonathan Haidt, the author of The Righteous Mind, five moral foundations govern all human ethics, virtues, and institutions: care, fairness, loyalty, authority, and sanctity. His Moral Foundations Hypothesis (MFH) claims that those with liberal ideologies are more sensitive to the care and fairness foundations, while those with conservative ideologies are equally sensitive to all five.

Why should we pay attention to what morals liberals or conservatives care more about? Often times we're frustrated by how biased, foolish, or illogical people become when they disagree with us over what we regard as fundamental virtues: a woman's right to privacy, gay rights, etc. But this makes a lot more sense when we understand that the members of America’s two political camps are, to a degree, blind to one or more of the moral foundations of the others. Therefore, they may perceive morally-driven words or behavior as having another basis—at best self-interested, at worst evil, and thus demonize one another. Readers should leave this essay having recognized that real change comes from understanding and appealing to the ethics of the other side.
