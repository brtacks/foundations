### George W. Bush, October 13, 2004

But as we **respect someone's rights** and as we **profess tolerance**, **we shouldn't change—or have to change** our basic views on the **sanctity of marriage**. I believe in the **sanctity of marriage**. I think it's very important that we **protect marriage as an institution** between a man and a woman.

**I proposed a constitutional amendment**. The reason I did so was because I was worried that **activist judges are actually defining** the definition of marriage. And the surest way to **protect marriage** between a man and woman is to amend the Constitution. It has also the benefit of allowing citizens to **participate in the process**. After all, when you amend the Constitution, **State legislatures must participate** in the ratification of the Constitution.

### John Kerry, October 13, 2004

**We're all God's children**, Bob, and I think if you were to talk to Dick Cheney's daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that shee's being who she was. **She's being who she was born as.** I think if you talk to anybody, **it's not choice**. I've met **people who've struggled with this for years**, people who were in a marriage because they were **living a sort of convention**, and **they struggled** with it. And I've met **wives who are supportive** of their husbands, or vice versa, when **they finally sort of broke out** and **allowed themselves** to live who they were, who they felt **God had made them**. I think we have to **respect** that.

**The President and I share** the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman. I believe that. I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. But I also believe that because **we are the United States of America**, we're a country with a great, unbelievable Constitution, with **rights that we afford people**, that **you can't discriminate** in the workplace. **You can't discriminate** in the rights that you afford people. **You can't disallow someone the right to visit their partner in a hospital**. You have to **allow people** to transfer property, which is why I'm for partnership rights and so forth.

# Summary

Morality binds; morality blinds.

According to Jonathan Haidt, the author of The Righteous Mind, five moral foundations govern all human ethics, virtues, and institutions: care, fairness, loyalty, authority, and sanctity. His Moral Foundations Hypothesis (MFH) claims that those with liberal ideologies are more sensitive to the care and fairness foundations, while those with conservative ideologies are equally sensitive to all five.

Why should we pay attention to what morals liberals or conservatives care more about? Often times we're frustrated by how biased, foolish, or illogical people become when they disagree with us over what we regard as fundamental virtues: a woman's right to privacy, gay rights, etc. But this makes a lot more sense when we understand that the members of America’s two political camps are, to a degree, blind to one or more of the moral foundations of the others. Therefore, they may perceive morally-driven words or behavior as having another basis—at best self-interested, at worst evil, and thus demonize one another. Readers should leave this essay having recognized that real change comes from understanding and appealing to the ethics of the other side.
